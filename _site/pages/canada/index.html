    <h3>PHARMACISTS IN CANADA</h3>

<p><strong>How to Become Registered Pharmacist In Canada ?</strong>
<br />
                   Canada has approximately 33,000 licensed pharmacists. Of those, 24,000 work in 8,600 community pharmacies and 5,600 work in hospitals. Pharmacists also work in the pharmaceutical industry, governments, colleges and universities and associations.<br />
What do Pharmacists do?<br />
                   Today’s pharmacists are highly respected as the medication management experts of the health care team. They collaborate with patients, their families and other health care providers to benefit the health of Canadians. The pharmacist’s traditional role is expanding, and pharmacists across Canada deliver a range of innovative services, including medication reviews, chronic disease management, immunization services and wellness programs. Most provincial governments have approved pharmacist prescribing with varying scopes of authority, a service that complements the care provided by a doctor and can result in more convenient refills, less time spent dealing with prescription changes and collaborative medication management.<br />
Becoming a Pharmacist in Canada<br />
In order to become a licensed pharmacist in Canada, you need:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>A bachelor’s or doctor of pharmacy degree from one of ten Canadian universities</li>
<li>To complete a national board examination through the Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (PEBC) (with the exception of Québec)</li>
<li>Practical experience through an apprenticeship/internship program</li>
<li>Fluency in English or French</li></ul>
<p>The profession of pharmacy is regulated on a provincial and territorial level. The regulatory authorities are directly responsible for granting pharmacist licenses, assessing the competency of pharmacists and ensuring public safety. For a detailed look at the specific provincial licensing requirements in every province, visit the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA).<br />
International Pharmacy Graduates (IPGs)<br />
                   Requirements for licensing of internationally trained pharmacists can be found on the PEBC website. To help IPGs successfully complete the licensing requirements, several programs are available:<br /></p>
<ul>
<li>The International Pharmacy Graduate Program — Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto in Toronto, ON</li>
<li>The Canadian Pharmacy Practice Programme — Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC</li>
<li>The International Pharmacy Bridging Program — Bredin Institute in Calgary, AB and Edmonton, AB</li></ul>
<p>PEBC Certification Process for International Pharmacy Graduates<br />
There are 3 steps to achieving PEBC pharmacist certification:<br />
STEP 1: Enroll in the Gateway – You must enroll in the Pharmacist Gateway Canada. go to website http://pharmacistsgatewaycanada.ca<br />
STEP 2: DOCUMENT EVALUATION – You must pass this evaluation of your educational and professional credentials to be eligible to write the<br /> PharmacistEvaluating Examination.
STEP 3: THE PHARMACIST EVALUATING EXAMINATION – You must pass this written examination to be eligible for the Pharmacist Qualifying Examination – Parts I and II.<br />
STEP 4: THE PHARMACIST QUALIFYING EXAMINATION, PART I (MCQ) and PART II (OSCE) – Your final step to qualifying for certification with PEBC.  When you have passed both Parts of the examination you will be certified and registered with PEBC.<br />
                      This Certificate is a major requirement for licensing in each province, but the Certificate alone does not mean you have the right to practice.<br />
                      In addition to the PEBC Certificate of Qualification, each province has additional licensing requirements. These may include practical experience, English or French language skills, and jurisprudence examinations. You must contact the regulatory authority of the province in which you choose to practice to receive full information about their requirements. The contact information for the provincial and territorial regulatory authorities is available on the PEBC website.<br />

<br /><br /><br />
STEP 1: Enroll in the Gateway: Enrolling in Pharmacists’ Gateway Canada allows you to begin your application for a licence. You will create an account and you will be given a candidate number. You will provide information such as your name, address and date of birth. With this account, you will be able to see any of your documents that are stored in the database. You can also track your progress throughout the licensing process. Before you enrol, you should understand all of the steps and requirements.<br />
Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (PRAs) across Canada support that enrollment in the Gateway be the first step in the licensure process. If you wish to practice in Québec, the enrollment is optional, but you may want to consider its advantages and try the self-assessment tools. It is strongly recommended that you use the self-assessment tools before enrolling in the Gateway. These tools will help you to understand the Canadian licensing process and the realities of the work environment. They will also help you to identify areas of pharmacy where you may need more education or experience. These tools will assist you in determining your readiness to pursue any steps in the process.<br /></p>

<p>STEP 2: Document Evaluation: You must pass this evaluation of your educational and professional credentials to be eligible to write the Pharmacist Evaluating Examination.<br />
