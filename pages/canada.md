<strong>How to Become Registered Pharmacist In Canada ?</strong>
<br >
                   Canada has approximately 33,000 licensed pharmacists. Of those, 24,000 work in 8,600 community pharmacies and 5,600 work in hospitals. Pharmacists also work in the pharmaceutical industry, governments, colleges and universities and associations.<br >
What do Pharmacists do?<br >
                   Today’s pharmacists are highly respected as the medication management experts of the health care team. They collaborate with patients, their families and other health care providers to benefit the health of Canadians. The pharmacist’s traditional role is expanding, and pharmacists across Canada deliver a range of innovative services, including medication reviews, chronic disease management, immunization services and wellness programs. Most provincial governments have approved pharmacist prescribing with varying scopes of authority, a service that complements the care provided by a doctor and can result in more convenient refills, less time spent dealing with prescription changes and collaborative medication management.<br >
