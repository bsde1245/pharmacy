**Diploma In IPR (Intellectual Property Right)**

Intellectual property Right (IPR) is a legal field that refers to creations of the mind such as musical, literary, and artistic works; inventions; and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce, including  copyrights, trademarks, patents, and related rights. Under intellectual property law, the holder of one of these abstract "properties" has certain exclusive rights to the creative work, commercial symbol, or invention which is covered by it.

Intellectual property rights give creators exclusive rights to their creations, thereby providing an incentive for the author or inventor to develop and share the information rather than keep it secret. The legal protections granted by IP laws are credited with significant contributions toward economic growth. Economists estimate that two-thirds of the value of large businesses in the U.S. can be traced to intangible assets. 
Likewise, industries whose reliance on IP protections are estimated to produce 72 percent more value per added employee than non-IP industries.

Additionally, a joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries and found that "a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth." However, correlation does not necessarily imply causation.

The study of intellectual property has grown in to a distinct academic discipline, most notably in law schools from higher education institutions in developed countries such as the UK, Germany, USA and Canada. Postgraduate courses (often referred to as an LLM or Master of Laws) are available for those looking to further their academic exposure and gain internationally recognised qualifications for intellectual property.
